# dll_test

Just to learn how to create dll without using VS.
Also to write code that can be used to create dll or to statically link against

This project uses Windows Subsystem for Linux to crosscompile C source code using mingw gcc compiler. For whatever reason the windows native mingw compiler has issues. I also had issues compiling in linux VM and copying sources over to windows host.
